## Machine Learning Algorithms
### Supervised Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- **Justification:** CNNs excel at object recognition by automatically learning features from data, particularly useful for identifying threats in drone imagery.
- **Limitation:** Require large amounts of labeled data and may struggle with complex environments or occluded scenes.
- **Mitigation:** Use data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance model robustness.

### Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning)
- **Justification:** Enables drones to learn optimal actions in dynamic environments without explicit supervision.
- **Limitation:** Can be slow to converge, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards.
- **Mitigation:** Implement reward shaping and use simulated environments to accelerate learning.

### Deep Learning (Recurrent Neural Networks)
- **Justification:** Efficiently processes sequential data with temporal dependencies, enabling drones to make timely decisions.
- **Limitation:** May struggle with learning long-term dependencies and require significant computational resources.
- **Mitigation:** Use advanced architectures like LSTM or GRU to handle long-term dependencies and optimize computational efficiency.

## Hypothesis
By leveraging machine learning algorithms, tactical drones can autonomously detect and neutralize threats with higher efficiency and accuracy than traditional human-controlled methods. This will be validated through rigorous testing and evaluation, demonstrating improved response times and mission success rates.

## Selected Algorithms
The project will utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for object recognition, Q-learning for decision-making, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for processing sequential data. These algorithms were chosen for their ability to handle the specific challenges of real-time threat detection and decision-making in dynamic environments.
